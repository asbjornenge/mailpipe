# MailPipe 

Mailpipe is an attempt at making a mail app for inbox-zero freaks. Mailpipe is inspired by [Mailbox](http://www.mailboxapp.com/). It uses React and Flux and supports multiple mail servers, no just GMail. It's default skin tries to make it look like a terminal app, just because. But I plan to support themes in the future.
