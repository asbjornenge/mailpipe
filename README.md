# TaskBox 

TaskBox is an email client. TaskBox is inspired by [Mailbox](http://www.mailboxapp.com/). 

## Story

I am an [Inbox Zero](http://www.43folders.com/izero) freak. It just means that I treat my email as tasks, and my inbox as my tasklist. I also do it with tweets btw. Things I sould read, watch, look into. They all make their way to my inbox and are turned into tasks. 

I have been using [Mailbox](http://www.mailboxapp.com/) on my phone since it launched and have been really really happy with it. I was also using the desktop version before switching to Linux a while back (because docker). Naturally, I was pretty bummed when they announced they were [saying goodbye](https://blogs.dropbox.com/mailbox/2015/12/saying-goodbye/).  

This however, inflamed another itch I've been having; services suck!! Unless they are F/OSS and I can host them myself I'm moving away. Same goes for apps. Moving to Linux and loosing the Mailbox desktop app has been a pain. So, I decided to scratch back and **TaskBox** was born.

So TaskBox is actually a YATA (yet another todo application).

I also like terminal apps.

Ironically I use firebase. I would prefer a indexdb sync thing.
